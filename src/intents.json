One solution that cities employ to decrease flooding from tides and storms is constructing seawalls.Raising roads above sea level can help drain water and reduce tidal flooding. Coastal communities can restore natural infrastructure, which can act as a buffer against storms and coastal flooding. Natural structures such as barrier islands, oyster and coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass, and salt marshes can work alone or in unison with built infrastructure, like seawalls, to absorb storm surge.Though communities are implementing many of the solutions available to help stave off extreme land loss, some are considering relocation.

Ocean acidification has the potential to affect food security. Commercially and ecologically important marine species will be impacted, although they may respond in different ways.

Laboratory studies suggest changing ocean chemistry will 1) harm life forms that rely on carbonate-based shells and skeletons, 2) harm organisms sensitive to acidity and 3) harm organisms higher up the food chain that feed on these sensitive organisms.
